# Chuzz Clicker

An over-the-top dual-face clicker inspired by Cookie Clicker. Tap SMALL D CHUZZ and FAT CHUZZ to farm vibes, unleash chaotic power-ups like **ULTIMATE CHUZZ** and **FAT CHUZZ**, and hunt for neon-soaked easter eggs hidden throughout the UI.

## Getting Started

This project is entirely static. To try it out locally run any static web server from the project root, for example:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit [http://localhost:8000/index.html](http://localhost:8000/index.html) in your browser.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. Push the repository to GitHub.
2. In the repo settings, enable **Pages** and choose **GitHub Actions** as the source.
3. Every push to `main` will publish the site via the included `.github/workflows/pages.yml` workflow. Once the action finishes, GitHub will provide the live URL so you can play the game directly from your browser.
